# Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for Taxi-v3 Environment

This project implements the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm for solving the Taxi-v3 environment from OpenAI Gym.

## Description

MCTS is a heuristic search algorithm for decision processes, notably used in game play. This implementation applies MCTS to the Taxi-v3 problem, a grid-world environment where a taxi needs to pick up and drop off passengers at specific locations.

Key features:
- Implementation of MCTS algorithm
- Application to the Taxi-v3 environment
- Visualization of the environment during execution

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- OpenAI Gym
